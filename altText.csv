Box plot,All,TRUE,133,Senior+ box at top is narrowest and on low end; three potential high outliers; other boxes are wider; tend higher scores than Senior+
Box plot,Spring '22,TRUE,139,"Sophomore box at bottom is largest, other two are simlilar size; Senior+ at top is lowest while Juniors highest with two potential outliers"
Box plot,Fall '22,TRUE,92,The one sophomore scored 8; Junior and Senior+ tended to score lower and show more variation
Box plot,Spring '23,TRUE,138,"Senior+ box at top shows most variation and tends to have higher score; Juniors are in the middle, Sophomores at bottom with lowest scores"
Histogram,All,FALSE,62,A positively skewed histogram with most scores between 0 and 3
Histogram,Spring '22,FALSE,47,Nearly rectangular histogram with dip in middle

Density,Spring '23,FALSE,87,"Starts high at 2 and increases nonlinearly to about 5, then decreases nonlinearly to 17"
Density,All,TRUE,119,Senior+ is right skewed with most density between 0 and 5 while Sophomore and Junior peak around 7.5 and 9 respectively
Density,Spring '22,TRUE,123,"Senior+ pleaks around 3; Junior is trimodal with peaks at 5, 8 and 11; sophomore is mostly flat with a slight peak around 8"
Density,Fall '22,TRUE,125,Senior+ is positively skewed with high density at 0; Juniors decrease more slowly; the one sophomore who scored 8 isn't shown
